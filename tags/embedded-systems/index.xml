      <description>Table of contents  Prerequisites Building the MicoPython application Flashing the MicroPython application References  Prerequisites  Before performing building and flashing operations we need to make sure that we have installed all the dependencies. For installing all the dependencies you can follow my previous blog or follow zephyr documentation. Since the BeagleConnect Freedom Board has not yet been merged in the Zephyr upstream please clone forked repository once all the remaining dependencies have been installed, remove the zephyr folder from the zephyrproject directory and paste the cloned zephyr folder into it to make sure that our board exists in the board directory while building it.</description>
