      <description>Table of contents 1)The BeagleConnect Freedom 2)What is MicroPython 3)Setting up Zephyr RTOS 4)QEMU 5)Building port on Zephyr RTOS 6)References  The Beagleconnect Freedom BeagleConnect is a revolutionary technology which eliminates low-level software development for IoT and IIoT applications, such as building automation, factory automation, and home automation. What sets it apart is that it eliminates the need of relying on software libraries enabling it to be used for interfacing a greater number of sensors, actuators and indicators for communicating over various networks compared to other conventional solutions.</description>

      <description>My name is Yadnik Bendale and I will be working on the project MicroPython for BeagleConnect Freedom(https://elinux.org/BeagleBoard/GSoC_2021/Micropython_for_BeagleConnect_Freedom).
The project includes porting MicroPython and CircuitPython support to the BeagleConnect Freedom Device as well as writing drivers for interfaces like GPIO, I2C, SPI, PWM, UART and ADC in MicroPython.</description>
